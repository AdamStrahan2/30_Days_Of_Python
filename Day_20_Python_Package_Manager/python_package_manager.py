# ------ Python Package Manager (PIP) ------

# --- What is PIP? ----
# PIP stands for Preferred installer program. We use pip to install different Python packages.
# A Package is a Python module that can contain one or more modules or other packages.
# A module or modules that we can install to our application is a package.
# In programming, we do not have to write every utility program,
# instead we install packages and import them to our applications.

# --- Checking if PIP is Installed ---
# Check if pip is installed by writing:
#pip --version

# --- Installing PIP ---
#  Go to your terminal or command prompt and copy and paste this:
#C:\Users\adams\PycharmProjects\30DaysOfPython> pip install pip

# --- Updating PIP ---
# Go to terminal and run this:
#python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

# ------ Installing Packages Using PIP ------

# --- Numpy ---
# Let us try to install numpy, called numeric python.
# It is one of the most popular packages in machine learning and data science community.
# NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
#   - a powerful N-dimensional array object
#   - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
#   - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
#   - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

#pip install numpy

# Let us start using numpy. Open your python interactive shell, write python and then import numpy as follows:
